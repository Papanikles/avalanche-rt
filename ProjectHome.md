# [Please read the following regarding Avalanche's future](http://code.google.com/p/avalanche-rt/wiki/TheFutureOfAvalanche) #


avalanche-rt is a web based front end for rTorrent. avalanche-rt provides a friendly frontend, loosely based on Clutch (Transmission's web interface).

rTorrent is a command line BitTorrent client, for use on Linux systems, including servers, seedboxes and Linux based devices such as a dd-wrt router.

**If you would like to purchase a seedbox I fully recommend [RapidServerz](http://rapidserverz.co.uk/billing/link.php?id=18) for good quality, fast seedboxes!**
